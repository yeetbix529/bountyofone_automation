# BountyOfOne Automation Testing

Welcome to my personal project, the BountyOfOne Automation Testing Framework. This project is all about utilizing the power of SikuliX, an open-source image recognition tool, to automate testing for the Bounty Of One Game, which can be found on Steam: [Bounty Of One on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968730/Bounty_of_One/).

## Project Overview
The core of this project is the automation of game checks using image recognition to enhance navigation within the Bounty Of One game. It aims to make the testing process more efficient and precise.

## Test Example
For a practical demonstration, you can watch a test example in action: [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/K0LUpkVQXjs)

### Requirements
To run this framework, you'll need to have Java installed. Additionally, you'll be using the SikuliX IDE to create and run tests. You can download a version of the IDE from [SikuliX's website](https://raiman.github.io/SikuliX1/downloads.html).

### Usage
Here are the steps to get started with the framework:
- Open 'OpenSikuliX_IDE.bat' for the IDE.
- Go to 'File' > 'Open.'
- Navigate to the 'scripts.sikuli' directory and select any files with the '.py' extension.
- Click 'Run' or 'Run in slow motion.'

### Notes
Please note the following:
- You'll need to have a shortcut on the desktop (an optimization to open via the command line is in the works).
- Ensure there's a clear view of the desktop screen behind the IDE; otherwise, image recognition may fail.

## Future Improvements
As this project evolves, I have some plans for future improvements:
- Exploring the use of pytest as a test runner for easier test management.
- Enhancing test designs. You can view the current test design [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UpWrzRSqfDXP_9hlPNWXFvVVdHpaLuLR9jGSBTet62A/edit?usp=sharing).
- Expanding the manual test portfolio. You can view the portfolio [here](https://www.figma.com/file/4NN6sqFuVJZpwaJEXaDDnr/Bounty-of-One%3A-Test-Portfolio?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=Vebh0LXrJ7jY5BiV-1).
