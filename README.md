Test Example: [Video](https://youtu.be/K0LUpkVQXjs)



Requirements: this framework is based on SikuliX open-source research project. I am currently using their IDE to create and run tests. 
You need a version of JAVA installed to run.
- A version of the IDE can be found here: [Download](https://raiman.github.io/SikuliX1/downloads.html)

Usage:
- Open OpenSikulix_IDE.bat for ide
- File > Open
- Scripts can be found in scripts.sikuli, select any of the files with the .py extension
- Select Run or Run in slow motion

notes:
- you need to have a short-cut on desktop // this will be updated soon to open via cmdline # optimisation
- make sure there there is clear view of the desktop screen behind the ide otherwise image-recognition fails

future changes
- it would be cool to try use pytest as the test-runner, and easier test management.
- improve test designs // [Design](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UpWrzRSqfDXP_9hlPNWXFvVVdHpaLuLR9jGSBTet62A/edit?usp=sharing)
- improve test manual test portfolio // [Portfolio](https://www.figma.com/file/4NN6sqFuVJZpwaJEXaDDnr/Bounty-of-One%3A-Test-Portfolio?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=Vebh0LXrJ7jY5BiV-1)
